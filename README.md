# Nothing-Laptop---Framebook-1-
The first fully functioning laptop that incorporates Nothing's design language.
The Framebook(1) is my passion project to create the first functional, (non-concept), Nothing laptop. It's essentially a mishmash of Nothing, Framework, and Apple, taking the defining and distinctive qualities of each to ammass them into my "perfect laptop." The Framebook(1) uses framework's 16" motherboard as the powerplant, allowing for not only unprecedented repairability, (RAM, SSD, GPU, Wi-Fi), but also a hefty amount of processing power. The system is also compatible with framework's expansion card and expansion bay ecosystem, making GPU upgraded not only possible but easy down the line. That said, the Framebook(1) only allows for four expansion cards compared to the FW16s six, as two slots are used to drive thw inbuilt keyboard, trackpad, rear notification display, rear e-ink display, and glyps. the other is for an in-the-works side expansion system that could facilitate a triple-screen setup via usb-c pogo pins. This is not yet complete though. 
Specs include:
- glyphs
- rear notification display (DO0241PVST06)
- 4k oled panel, (samsung  ATNA60YV02-0)
- 99WH battery (still looking for pouch cells of the correct size)
- full aluminium construction
- wireless charging on laptop lid

  It has some drawbacks as well however. it doesnt have a webcam, instead relying on the GCam app and a magsafe mod to provide video using your phones front camera. I exclusively use earbuds as well, so no speakers are engineered into the design. CAD and pcb design will be posted shortly. I cant afford to build it right now, but maybe someone else who looks for the same qualities in a laptop than me might.
