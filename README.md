The Framebook(1) is a project to create the first functional, (non-concept), Nothing laptop. It's essentially a mishmash of Nothing, Framework, and Apple, taking the defining and distinctive qualities of each to ammass them into a "perfect laptop" for a specific consumer base. The Framebook(1) uses framework's 16" motherboard as the motherboard, allowing for not only repairability, (RAM, SSD, GPU, Wi-Fi), but also a reasonable amount of processing power. It's fairly comparable to the M1 Max series of chips released by Apple, or M3 pro. The system is also compatible with framework's expansion card and expansion bay ecosystem, making GPU upgraded not only possible but easy down the line. That said, the Framebook(1) only allows for four expansion cards compared to the FW16s six, as two slots are used to drive the inbuilt keyboard, trackpad, rear notification display, rear e-ink display, and glyps. the other is for an in-the-works side expansion system that could facilitate a triple-screen setup via usb-c pogo pins. This is not yet complete though. 
Specs include:
- glyphs
- rear notification display (DO0241PVST06)
- 4k oled panel, (samsung  ATNA60YV02-0)
- 99WH battery (still looking for pouch cells of the correct size)
- full aluminium construction
- wireless charging on laptop lid

  It has some drawbacks as well however. it doesnt have a webcam, instead relying on the GCam app and a magsafe mod to provide video using your phones front camera. Most people seem to use earbuds as well, so no speakers are engineered into the design. CAD and pcb design will be posted in the near future. I cant afford to build it personally right now, but maybe someone else who looks for the same qualities in a laptop might.

It's also impossible to understate how out of the question this project would be without everyone at Framework who have made the mainboard that's powering this, and then open sourced it. Thanks guys!
